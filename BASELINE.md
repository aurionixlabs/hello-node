# Baseline Gate v1

This repository contains a frozen enforcement baseline proving:

- Non-bypassable tool execution gating
- Degraded execution mode (confirmation_required)
- Hard blocking of unauthorized tools
- Separation between decision and execution
- Fail-closed behavior under constraint violation

Tag: baseline-gate-v1
Proof Tag: proof-v1-non-bypassable-gate

This baseline must not be refactored.
All future work must preserve these behaviors.
